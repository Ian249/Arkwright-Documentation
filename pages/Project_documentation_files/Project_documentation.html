    My project aims to prevent the need for regular, manual refilling of water bodies e.g., ponds. It uses a programmed Arduino to read sensors measuring turbidity, light levels and water depth, automatically opening and shutting motorised valves, letting unclean water out and then refilling from a larger reservoir.
    
    <li class="headings"><span>Beginning the project</span></li>
    
    The idea for the project comes from our regular need to refill and clean a small pond we have for ducks, a task which I thought could be made autonomous. The system, refilling from a larger tank that naturally collects rain, means that the pond water deteriorates less before it is automatically refilled, as opposed to being manually refilled. The first things to do to realise the idea were to decide on the method I would use to check how clean the water was, and to decide how I would implement the changing of water. After research I found that a turbidity sensor could use infrared light to establish the level of particulate matter in the water, by measuring the infrared intensity received by the sensor. To reduce inaccuracies caused by light intensity in its environment I also decided to include an external light sensor and code it so that it would also check the water at after a certain threshold each day. For the valves and the water connections, I would also need sections of hose with “quick connections” both within the valve and connecting to the hose, as well as watertight connections with the containers. Additionally, to prevent against potential leaks from higher pressure, I also used a sealant with these connections.
    
    After I had the initial Arduino, valve, and sensor components, I decided to code simple programmes to test each of the sensors and become more accustomed to the C++ based Arduino library. This therefore involved using the correct Arduino pinouts for each of the components and learning how to read and use the Serial monitor. The motor that I found would work for my project had five wires, however only three of these were need. The way I needed to control it was using the parallel circuit wires, powering one to open the valve and the other to close it. The third would be to ground. The other sensors required a digital pin for power, a ground pin and an analogue pin to allow the Arduino to read it and feed back to the programme’s various functions. The wiring of the components also required a breadboard and a wooden board to organise the system effectively.
    
    <li class="headings"><span>The code</span></li>
    
    The main section of the project was coding the Arduino to perform the required functions, opening and closing the valves when required. After finding out how to code the basics of the Arduino library, I began to write the full code. 
    Starting the object-oriented programme, I first laid out a structure and as such, I began by outlining the basic functions such as “openValve” and “readTurbiditySensor” and declaring the global variables I would need, for example “depthSensorAnalogue” or “turbidityLevel” shown in figure 1. I also wrote in the Arduino “void Loop” and “void Setup” functions.
                                                                                 Fig. 1
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Figure 1 shows how I declared the pinouts for the Arduino, with the digital pins for passing current through the sensors and analogue pins reading the returned value. The returned values taken from an “analogRead” function are then passed to other global variables.
    The function I used for the opening of the valves was a simple one, requiring the code seen in figure 2 to run current to the correct pin and power the motor.
                                                                                                                Fig. 2
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    In order to avoid leaking water from the system if there was a problem, and to have a reset switch that closed both the valves should I need to quickly stop the program, I included code in the “void Setup()”  function that would close the motors and then delay ten seconds, to allow me to shut down the program. The setup function is used to setup the various pins to allow an output of either “HIGH or  LOW” voltage to be applied using the code shown in figure 3. It is also used to setup the USB connection to the Arduino, using “serial.begin(9600)”  to set the baud rate (signal change per section).

    During the testing of the system, it was important to know which sections functioned as they should have, and which sections may have been causing problems. There are therefore multiple “Serial.println” statements in the code to indicate to me what code ran and where problems lay. 
    One of the first problems in my code was an error that caused the sensors to constantly repeat zeros. Initially I was powering the pin, reading it and then stopping current. To try to fix the issue I left the pin on high for several reads then stopped. I could not use this code however as returning the power every time to low prevents any damage to the sensor through constant power input.  
    This led me to realise that it was returning zeros because it was not being powered when it read the sensor, therefore the code must have been running faster than the time taken to alter the pin status. The solution for this was to include delay code between setting the pin to high and reading it as shown in Figure 2, allowing the sensor time to turn on and then read the result.
    Unfortunately, for the depth sensor I used to stop the water level getting too high after refilling, residue was left over from when the tank was full of turbid water. This caused the sensor to read false values and so the solution was to ensure no water covered the top of the sensor (where the non-waterproof electronics were), by adding a “millis()” function, counting the milliseconds since the valve was opened to add a bound to how long the water could fill for. This could only work in the actual product provided the pressure from the upper reservoir never increased enough to cause water to reach the electronics before this time.
    Additionally, whilst I could use a depth sensor for refilling the tank, I found that I would not be able to use one for the emptying of the turbid water because the non-waterproof components would have to sit below the waterline to properly read the lowest level of depth in order to control the motor. I thought about pushing the sensor up through the base of the tank, sealing it and inverting the code to account for the inverted values, however the thin section of the sensor would mean I would not be able to seal it efficiently enough to prevent pressure from pushing it out and risking the pond leaking. However, because roughly an equal volume of water would be in the pond at the time of emptying, it would be valid to use another timer function to close the valve at a specific point. Testing the system allowed me to find the correct values for these timings.
    When the code was written, I tested the sensors again but used the apparatus to determine the optimum values, for example, the height the water reached on the depth sensor should not exceed 550 as this risked damaging the electrical components . 
    
        The average light function.
            
    In the project, I used a turbidity sensor which uses the intensity of light received from a self-contained source to determine the levels of particles in the water and hence turbidity. I concluded that, though this would be accurate, in order to not waste any water by cleaning it too often, the sensors should be as accurate as possible and therefore I would use a light sensor, only checking turbidity at a certain threshold and removing any errors that might arise from darkness in contrast to daytime.
    
    For this light sensor, it seemed that as light intensity varied slowly throughout the day and obstructions would cause a false reading, I would need to read the sensor at long, regular intervals and create a function which would take a moving average to help remove potential anomalies from obstructions or shadow.
    
    Initially, I questioned whether an array would work as it would be difficult to remove and change the correct value in the list over time. I therefore considered whether I could achieve this using a C++ class of “lightlevels”, with six objects of lightlevels to alter each time using “push” and “pop” to remove and add values every time a value in read. Whilst thinking of this, I found I would need to use an iteration variable to change which value is removed every time the light sensor is used.
    
    Realising this, it seemed that simply using arrays may work, leading to the code shown in figure 4. Every time I ran the code for the light test, the variable “Iteration” increased by one, meaning that by adding a mod 6 function, I could alter each value of the list in sequence, changing the moving average each time a new value is registered.

    The structure
    
    After the main functions of the code had been written, I felt that I needed to improve the structure to make it less computationally intensive. The best way to do this would be using a coding structure such as a class which I have used before in Python. In this code, a class object “waterCleaner” would allow me to use the functions as methods within the class and apply them to the object, also making them more legible.
    Applying this worked to simplify the code well, however the difficulty was still in coordinating the response from sensors with the opening and closing of motors, as delay functions would prevent the next section from working. Some code still ran too fast and ignored the feedback loops.
    To fix this, I found a better way to structure my code using ‘enums’. Using this, I created an ‘enum class’ consisting of elements of states (“STATE_LIST”) that the water cleaner could be in. One would test for light levels, and if high enough, turbidity levels, and the other would operate the valve system and the depth tests. To use this new structure, I created another function “runProgram” which would change the state of the system to test the sensors and hence if the values were correct, change the state to in order to clean the water. In “void loop()”, I then called the function to run the program repeatedly, constantly checking to move to the next function. Figure 5 shows this overall structure with the functions and the enum class.

    <div class="headings"><span>The Infrastructure</span></div>
    To test the code and the practicality of the project, I created apparatus to hold the sensors and motors in place. For the tanks, I simply used plastic containers that were big enough to contain enough water, creating pressure and testing the seals - but also small enough to work with the small-scale system and not cause too much pressure. Standard food containers worked well for this. 
    For the connections between the 3/4-inch diameter hose piping and the valves, I needed to use a screw in quick connection to the motor and from that a quick connector to the hose. This setup is shown in figure 6 and the motor was placed into another container to take contain leaks during testing. In the case of one of the connections, it was necessary to add a small amount of sealant to close a leak from the upper reservoir.
     
    Next, I connected the hose sections to the containers. This involved drilling holes with a circular drill bit to push through a hose connection. This however needed additional sealant to ensure it was watertight, seen in figure 7.

                                                                         Fig. 8                                                                             Fig. 9
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
     
    Figure 8 shows the way I was able to rest the sensors at the correct height in relation to the water. I found brackets that I could rest around the container. The project had to be coded so that the water level could never exceed the top of the turbidity sensor (left) and the top of the depth sensor (right) as these electronics were not waterproof. 
    For the light sensor shown in figure 9 it was necessary to solder the wires to the light sensor, which would be horizontal on the larger scale product for the most accurate reading.
    Figure 10 shows the electronics connected to the Arduino through the breadboard. I organised them on the wooden board. I only needed 2 ground pins connected to the Arduino as I could join up the inputs with the breadboard. The complete construction is shown in figure 11, the containers needing to be above each other to ensure the constant flow of water through the system. Due to the shorter wires of the motor, I kept them near the central Arduino.

    <div class="headings"><span>Difficulties and successes</span></div>
    Mostly the difficulties came from the physical limitations of the small-scale model. For example, with precision made connections and rubber seals, I would have been able to include the depth sensor underneath the water to cut off the emptying of the pond. The depth sensor also responded to the droplets of residue which caused the necessary timer mechanisms. Depending on the size of the pond and upper reservoir it may also be necessary to  include small pumps to increase the pressure. With the code, the main problem came with the structure and keeping the functions running in sequence with the correct inputs.
    Overall, the model was a good representation of the concept, showing how the sensors can be used and with adjustments such as more sensors combined with averages, the code could be used with a larger scale model. In the future, ideas would include creating better infrastructure to survive outdoors and protect the sensors/electronics. For the code, potentially including wireless network connectivity to review the data from specific sensors, view the code and run commands from a phone to identify faults without disturbing infrastructure would be immensely useful.
